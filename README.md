# A Novel Motion Control Workflow for Capturing and Reproducing Realistic Lens Flares
Lens flares are a common optical artifact in photography and filmmaking caused by reflections and scattering within a camera system. While they can degrade image quality, lens flares are sometimes harnessed artistically to enhance visual appeal. This reasearch captures lens flares using a motion control setup.
It harnesses image based and machine learning interpolation techniques to represent the flare artifacsts faithfully in compositing.
